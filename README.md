App Overview
------------
A simple node.js application intended to demonstrate how to
communicate with SPI devices with Intel(R) IoT platforms such
as Intel(R) Edison as the master device.

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data
protocol used by microcontrollers for communicating with one or
more peripheral devices quickly over short distances.

With an SPI connection there is always one master device
(usually a microcontroller) which controls the peripheral devices.

Typically there are three lines common to all the devices:

* MISO (Master In Slave Out) - The Slave line for sending data to the master,
* MOSI (Master Out Slave In) - The Master line for sending data to the peripherals,
* SCK (Serial Clock) - The clock pulses which synchronize data transmission generated by the master
and one line specific for every device:
* SS (Slave Select) - the pin on each device that the master can use to enable and disable specific devices.

When a device's Slave Select pin is low, it communicates with the master.
When it's high, it ignores the master. This allows you to have multiple SPI
devices sharing the same MISO, MOSI, and CLK lines.


```javascript
var m = require('mraa'); //require mraa

// helper function to go from hex val to dec
function char(x) {
    return parseInt(x, 16);
}

var x = new m.SPI(0);
var buf = new Buffer(4);
buf[0] = char('0xf4');
buf[1] = char('0x2e');
buf[2] = char('0x3e');
buf[3] = char('0x4e');
var buf2 = x.write(buf);
console.log("Sent: " + buf.toString('hex') + ". Received: " + buf2.toString('hex'));
```

This sends 4 bytes on MOSI and if connected correctly will yield a 4 buffer
object with the result on MISO and print both. Connect MOSI to MISO and input
should match the result.

Acceptable parameters to the SPI constructor depends on the amount of SPI
buses & chip selects you have. Mraa considers every chip select on every bus
to be represented by a SPI object. But 0 is always the default.

SPI pins are 10/11/12/13.
    * Pin 10 >> SS
    * Pin 11 >> MOSI
    * Pin 12 >> MISO
    * Pin 13 >> SCK

Tested IoT Node.js Platforms
----------------------------
* [Intel速 Galileo Board](http://intel.com/galileo)
* [Intel速 Edison Development Platform](http://intel.com/edison)

This sample can run on other IoT [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) development
platforms, that include the appropriate sensor hardware, but may require
changes to the I/O initialization and configuration code in order to work on
those other platforms.
