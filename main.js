    The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) sample application distributed within IntelÂ® XDK IoT Edition under the IoT with Node.js Projects project creation option showcases how to communicate with SPI devices with Intel(R) IoT platforms such as Intel(R) Edison as the master device.

    MRAA - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on GNU/Linux platforms
    Library in C/C++ to interface with Galileo & other Intel platforms, in a structured API with port names/numbering that match compatible boards & with bindings to javascript.

    Steps for installing MRAA & UPM Library on Intel IoT Platform with IoTDevKit Linux* image and an active internet connection
    Using a ssh client: 
    1. echo "src maa-upm http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/1.1/intelgalactic" > /etc/opkg/intel-iotdk.conf
